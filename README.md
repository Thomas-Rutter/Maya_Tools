# Maya_Tools
Python Tools created for Autodesk Maya

Work in the "Dissertation" folder is the code I submitted for my dissertation. I cannot stress enough how much I have learnt since then and my coding standards have dramatically improved.

I've kept it visible as I think it's good to showcase my very first work as well as my more recent work which is more reflective of my current ability.
